👋 Hi, I’m @Isabelly03

👀 I’m interested in mechatronics, IoT, and robotics.
🌱 I’m currently learning GAAL (Linear Algebra), drawing techniques, and working on improving my line-following robot.
💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on automation projects, IoT development, and coding improvements for robotics.
📫 How to reach me: Feel free to DM me or connect via LinkedIn (if you want to add a specific platform or email, let me know!).
😄 Pronouns: She/Her.
⚡ Fun fact: I’ve built two versions of a robot named Butter! One worked over Bluetooth and the other with a custom app I created.
